# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm **Lucas Martínez Aguilera**, a web developer in progress 🚀, currently studying **DAW**.  
I’m all about **fullstack development** and love building projects that are both **practical** and **fun**.  

💻 Here you'll find projects that reflect my journey as a developer, from logic puzzles to web apps!  
I'm always curious and up for learning new things to keep up with how the world is evolving. 🌐
